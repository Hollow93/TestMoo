SSL certificates
By default a self-signed certificate is created. It is enough for local instances.

Setting up a public instance do the following:

docker-compose exec moodle bash

rm /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf
rm -r /etc/letsencrypt/live
/certbot-setup.sh
exit

docker-compose restart moodle
To renew the certificate later just run the /certbot-setup.sh within the container.
